# Images Directory

This directory contains images for the SunBot Robotics website.

## Directory Structure

- `courses/` - Course-related images
- `gallery/` - Gallery photos of students and activities

## Current Status

The website currently uses placeholder images from `via.placeholder.com`. 

## Adding Your Images

1. **Replace placeholder images** in the HTML files:
   - Update `<img src="...">` tags to point to your actual images
   - Recommended formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`
   - Recommended image sizes:
     - Course cards: 400x200px
     - Gallery thumbnails: 400x400px (square)
     - Hero banners: 1200x600px
     - About section: 500x400px

2. **Optimize images** for web:
   - Compress images to reduce file size
   - Use appropriate formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)
   - Consider WebP format for better compression

3. **Naming conventions**:
   - Use lowercase with hyphens: `robotics-coding-class.jpg`
   - Be descriptive: `student-working-robot.jpg`
